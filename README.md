SM_Practical
List of Experiements: Simulation and modelling:

1 Generation of Random number series using built-in function and Congruential Random Number Generation Function

2 Simulation of PurePersuitProblem

3 SingleServerQueueSimulation + Generation of Random Numbers

4 Calculation of central values for lists(mean,median,mode,variance,standard deviation, coefficient of correlation)

5 Simulation of two server, single queue system

6 Select the best strategy for inventory management in a tyre shop

7 Given the age of different persons with their frequencies, calculate simple mean of age and plot graph between age and frequency. a. Generate a list of 100 random numbers between 10-100 representing the age of the people. Draw the bar graph of people between the age of 10-20, 21-30,31-40, 41-50,51-60,61-70,71-80,81-90,91-100. b. Calculate the following statistics of the people mean, median, mode , variance, standard deviation of complete data in scilab.

8 To find the Covariance and Correlation For age and frequency Where a. age==[46,53,29,61,36,39,47,49,52,38,55,32,57,54,4 4] and b. Frequency = [12,15,7,17,10,11,11,12,14,9,16,8,18,14,12];

9 We have a about vehicle performance. Miles per gallon is represented by matrix m and corresponding weight of car is represented by W matrix. Find covariance and correlation between these parameters. Plot the data set. a. Create two arrays of random numbers representing the weight array and performance array. b. The weight of the vehicle can be 1000Kg -6000Kg c. Performance of the vehicle can vary between 6-15gallons/miles

10 Simulation of Water reservoir for the problem discussed in class.
